### To run:

$```node crawler```

You will be prompted for a url. Here's how to get that url.

1. Go to yelp.com and search for `fast casual` in your desiered zip code.
2. On the first results page select a Distance. Walking is selected by default however if you want to use Walking you must select another distance than walking again. (The point is to get the hash in the url bar which only happens after manually selecting a distance.)
3. Copy the url from your browser.
